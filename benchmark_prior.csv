Benchmark prior,,,,,

"Each row has the specification pdf, arg1, arg2, mask, fix",,,,,
The pdf shape of the prior density is given by:,,,,,
1,Beta,"mean, std",,,
2,GAMMA,"mean, std",,,
3,Normal,"mean, std",,,
4,invgamma,"(s^2,nu)",,,
5,uniform,"a,b",,,

arg1,1st argument for pdf,,,,
arg2,2nd argument for pdf,,,,
mask ,1 if the parameter is fixed to a constant,,,,
fix,fixed parameter value (0 if mask=0),,,,
