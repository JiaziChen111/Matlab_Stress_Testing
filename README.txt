These programs estimate a basic Smets/Wouters NKDSGE model and generate h-step ahead forecasts of model variables.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Put the files in the Matlab subdirectory in your path !

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The raw data is the files (see the Schorfheide, Sill, Kryshko (IJF 2010) for data definitions):
	usModelData.xlsx
The data for estimation are in:
	usModelData.txt (exported from sheet3 of usModelData.xlsx)
	usModelDataRaw.txt (exported from sheet1 of usModelData.xlsx -- this file is not needed for estimation)

See the file FcstSetup.m to see how the data are read in to Matlab

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The estimation program is nkmp_pm.m

It uses data on priors from the file benchmark_prior.csv and starting values for the minimization from the file benchmark_start.csv  .

By default, posterior simulator draws are put in c:/output/matlab/date/

You will probably want to change line 58 in the file to reflect the actual sample period dates

As currently configured, the program generates 1e6 draws from the MHRW simulator  -- takes about 8 hours on a 2.8Ghz Wintel machine

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Forecasts are generated using the file dsgefcst.m

You will need to change line 13 to point to the MHRW draws generated by nkmp_pm.m

As well, you will want to alter FcstSetup.m to reflect the kickoff point for the forecast (line 38) and the number of forecast
steps (line 36).

If the program doesn't run CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE FILES IN THE MATLAB SUBDIRECTORY ARE IN YOUR PATH!!
